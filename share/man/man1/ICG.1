.TH ICG 1 "May 17, 2000" "Trick" "Trick User's Manual"
.SH NAME
ICG \- run the Trick Interface Code Generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBICG\fP [\fB-d\fP] [\fB-c\fP] \fI<data_structure_file_name.h>\fP
.PP
\fBICG\fP [\fB-u\fP]      for measurement unit summary
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBICG\fP \fIstructure_file.h\fP invokes the Trick Interface Code Generator
on the data structure and/or enumerated type definition file
\fIstructure_file.h\fP.
\fBICG\fP generates source code (in C) which is used by the Trick executive
to perform input and output to/from the data structures defined in
\fIstructure_file.h\fP.
\fBICG\fP also generates catalog database entries for all data
structures and enumerated types which it parses, and Hypertext Mark-up Language
(HTML) which helps to document the data structures and enumerated types.
.PP
\fBICG\fP
should be executed from the directory containing \fIstructure_file.h\fP.
This may be the model directory itself, or a directory called \fIinclude\fP
in the model directory.  The catalog information, source code and HTML
generated by \fBICG\fP are placed in directories called \fIcatalog\fP,
\fIio_src\fP, and \fIhtml\fP, respectively, in the model directory.
.PP
\fBICG\fP must be performed on all data structure files before the
\fBMIS\fP(1) or \fBmake_build\fP(1) processors are run.  These two tools
process all the source code files in the version directory, including those
generated by \fBICG\fP.
.SS Options
.TP
\fB-d\fP
Debug mode.  \fBICG\fP will echo \fIstructure_file.h\fP to the screen as
it is processed.  This helps the user find errors in his structure definition
file.
.TP
\fB-c\fP
Do not trap the common UNIX and USER signals.  This feature allows a core to be dumped.
.TP
\fB-u\fP
Display units.  \fBICG\fP will display a list of the valid measurement units
components.  These are used in the measurement units fields of the
parameter comments in a structure definition (.h) file.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fIio_src/io_\fPstructure_file\fI.c\fP
The I/O code is put in files with names of the form:
\fIio_\fPstructure_file\fI.c\fP, one for each \fIstructure_file.h\fP processed
by \fBICG\fP.
.TP
\fIhtml/io_\fPstructure_file\fI.h.html\fP
The HTML is put in files with names of the form:
\fIio_\fPstructure_file\fI.h.html\fP, one for each \fIstructure_file.h\fP
processed by \fBICG\fP.
.TP
\fIcatalog/structures\fP
Contains database information about the data structures which is used by
\fBCP\fP(1).
.TP
\fIcatalog/enumerated\fP
Contains database information about the enumerated data types which is used by
\fBCP\fP(1).
.TP
\fIcatalog/depends\fP
Contains database information about which files depend on which other files.
\fBICG\fP inserts dependency information for header files, \fBMIS\fP(1) inserts
dependency information for source code files.  This information is used by
\fBCP\fP(1).
.TP
\fI${TRICK_HOME}/catalog/catalog\fP
Contains paths to all model catalog directories.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBcatalog\fP(1), \fBCP\fP(1), \fBmake_build\fP(1)
.PP
All Trick model developers and users should go through the tutorial found
in the \fITrick Simulation Environment User Training Materials\fP.
The canonical reference for all Trick commands, files and utilities is the
\fITrick Simulation Environment User's Guide\fP.  Information specific to a
given release of Trick tools is contained in the \fITrick Simulation
Environment Version Description\fP for that release.

.SH BUGS
Known bugs will be placed in the \fIVersion Description Document\fP located in
$TRICK_HOME/docs area.  If you would like to report a bug, contact
